# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey is to gather insights from current AND previous employees in entry-level and low-level positions about their job satisfaction, challenges, and reasons for leaving ( or if they consider leaving) the company 

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population: All current and former employees who have worked in entry- or lower-level positions within the company in the past few months  (i.e., 6?)

sampling frame: The companyâ€™s HR database with records of active and recently exited employees in entry-level/low-level roles

sampling units: employees (current and former)

observational units: the individual employees?
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. What was your department and job title at the company?
2. How long did you work (or have you been working) at the company? (please answer in months)
3. How satisfied were you with your role overall? (this could be a categorical question with options: very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatisfied)
4. How would you rate the support you received from your immediate manager/supervisor?
5. Were there clear opportunities for career advancement or promotion within your role?
6. How satisfied were you with your compensation (salary, benefits, etc.) relative to your responsibilities?
7.  If you have left the company, what were the main reasons? (categorical question with options: Lack of growth; Low compensation ;poor management; Company culture ; Better opportunity elsewhere;  Workload/stress ; Other (please specify): ______)

```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type
    stratified random sampling method 
2. Sample size
    not sure.. I coudln't find the number 
3. Target population
    persons aged 15 years and over living in private households in Canada, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and full time residents of institutions
4. Sampling frame
   "This survey uses a frame that combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. "
5. Survey mode(s) 
     Data collection was conducted through computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and, for the first time in this cycle, an electronic questionnaire (EQ) completed online by respondents
6. Timeline
    every 5 years?
7. Response rate
    The overall response rate is 41.9%
8. Weights
    didn't really specify ... "Survey estimates were adjusted (weighted) to represent all persons in the target population, including those not covered by the survey frame" 
9. Data processing
    "Processing used the SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities to allow subject matter and survey support staff to specify and run the processing of the survey in a timely fashion with high quality outputs.It used a structured environment to monitor the processing of data ensuring best practices and harmonized business processes were followed"
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
    Missing or inconsistent responses were addressed through imputation methods, such as donor imputation
11. Sources of error
    "Edits were performed automatically and manually at various stages of processing at macro and micro levels. They included family, consistency and flow edits. Family relationships were checked to ensure the integrity of matrix data. A series of checks were done to ensure the consistency of survey data. An example was to check the respondent age against the respondent birth date. Flow edits were used to ensure respondents followed the correct path and fix off-path situations. Error detection was done through edits programmed into the CATI system"
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
     exclusion of residents from the territories and full-time residents of institutions. Also, the introduction of the electronic questionnaire could introduce mode effects, potentially affecting how respondents interpret and answer questions.
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used
